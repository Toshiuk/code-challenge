<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

Many times, navigating through this world of coding art, I come across this popular "generative trees". I had the idea of trying to do it without any previous research, just with the knowledge I currently have. At the end of this tree, I intend to study and have a before and after result. So yeah... it's a boring tree (for now).

### Libraries used

- [P5.js](https://p5js.org/)
- [gui.dat](https://github.com/dataarts/dat.gui)
